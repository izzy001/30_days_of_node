Hashing and HMAC

crypto module in node js is used to provide cryptographic functionalities.
It includes a set of wrappers for OpenSSL's hash, HMAC, verify, cipher, decipher and sign functions.

What is hashing?
Hashing is a process of generating a fixed length value from a string using mathematical functions.
It is used for providing security.

Features of Hash generated using hashing:
1.Unique 2.Fixed Length 3.Irreversible


Unique: In hashing unique input === unique output.

Fixed Length: Hashing algorithms always generate the hash with the same length. The length of input does not affect the length of the output.

Irreversible: Generated hashes are Irreversible in nature. We can not change the hash to the input text again.

Examples of different hashing algorithms
1. md5 hashing algorithm: hash value is exactly 32 digits long
2. whirlpool
3. SHA1
4. SHA224
5. SHA256
6. SHA384
7. SHA512
8. ripemd-160

Performing hashing on a file:

Hashing a file is done using 1.node.js streams 2.node.js filesystem 3.SHA256 


Problems with hashing: The rainbow table which is precomputed table for reversng cryptographic hash functions.

What is HMAC ?
HMAC (keyed-hash message authentication code) is a kind of MAC (Message Authentication Code ) whicj involves performing the hash functions using a secret cryptograhic key.
Just like hash, in HMAC also every generated hash is using hashing algorithms, hence exhibit same features.
